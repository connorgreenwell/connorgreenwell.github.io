      <description>A web app with the lighthearted goal of identifying REU sites that satisfy both a students research interests and their musical taste. Suggested sites are defined as those that are within the intersection of states that contain a relevant REU site and states that will host a concert by the relevant artist that summer (e.g. &amp;ldquo;states that contain micro-biology&amp;rdquo; &amp;cap; &amp;ldquo;states that will host Kanye West&amp;rdquo;).
This was written in less than 12 hours as part of the UK ACM&amp;rsquo;s Fall 2014 Hackathon.</description>
