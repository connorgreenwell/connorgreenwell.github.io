<p>While face analysis from images is a well-studied area, little work has
explored the dependence of facial appearance on the geographic location from
which the image was captured. To fill this gap, we constructed GeoFaces, a
large dataset of geotagged face images, and used it to examine the
geo-dependence of facial features and attributes, such as ethnicity, gender, or
the presence of facial hair. Our analysis illuminates the relationship between
raw facial appearance, facial attributes, and geographic location, both
globally and in selected major urban areas. Some of our experiments, and the
resulting visualizations, confirm prior expectations, such as the predominance
of ethnically Asian faces in Asia, while others highlight novel information
that can be obtained with this type of analysis, such as the major city with
the highest percentage of people with a mustache.</p>
