<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>The images uploaded to social networking websites are a rich source of
information about the appearance of people around the world. We present a
system, GeoFaceExplorer, for collecting, processing, browsing, and analyzing
this data. GeoFaceExplorer allows for the crowdsourced collection of human
facial images, as well as automated and interactive visual analysis of the
geo-dependence of facial appearance and visual attributes, such as ethnicity,
gender, and whether or not a person is wearing glasses. As a case study,
automated approaches are applied to detect common facial attributes in a large
set of geo-tagged human faces, leading to several analysis results that
illuminate the relationship between raw facial appearance, facial attributes,
and geographic location.  We show how the distribution of these attributes
differs in ten major urban areas. Our analysis also shows a similar expected
distribution of ethnicity within large urban areas in comparison to manually
collected U.S. census data. In addition, by applying automated hierarchical
clustering to facial attribute similarity, we find a large degree of overlap
between discovered regional clusters and geographical and national boundaries.</p>
