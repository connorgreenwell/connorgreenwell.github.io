<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>We propose to use deep convolutional neural networks to estimate the transient
attributes of a scene from a single image. Transient scene attributes describe
both the objective conditions, such as the weather, time of day, and the
season, and subjective properties of a scene, such as whether or not the scene
seems busy. Recently, convolutional neural networks have been used to achieve
state-of-the-art results for many vision problems, from object detection to
scene classification, but have not previously been used for estimating
transient attributes. We compare several methods for adapting an existing
network architecture and present state-of-the-art results on two benchmark
datasets. Our method is more accurate and significantly faster than all
previous methods, enabling real-world applications.</p>
